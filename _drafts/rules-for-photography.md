So in the spirit of experimentation photography is specifically allowed on Rogue Rope. This is until somebody does something that makes me revise this policy. So see it as a shared responsibility to make this happen in a good atmosphere.

So, long story short, you can take pictures if: 

- You **don't ask** by people to take a picture. 
- There's no one in the background.  

*Also*
- Don't ask people in the background to move.
- The event comes first, photography second.

So this limits the opportunities.  
The best way seems to be to use one of the other rooms, or wait till most people are gone , or contact me and come extra early, or talk to me and I'll let you use the space for a private photo session.
