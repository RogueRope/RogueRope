Is it spring or global warming? Or both?  Anyway, I'm walking on sunshine lately. 

The writer in me is already on holiday, so here's the quick'n dirty.

1. Mark your calendar with a big fat red cross on the second of March.
2. Then, click 'I'm going' on the event on Fetlife. 
3. And send in the form.
4. Prepare for the awesomness.

See you in Ghent for ropey delights.
