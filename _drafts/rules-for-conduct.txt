The session proposes an experimental space. 

#virtues:

##Presence
Be completely here. Switch of your mobile phone. Cellphone use is not welcome at Kinky Salon. Keep your phone stashed. If you need to use your phone, take it outside. That means calls, texting, social networkingâ€¦ 

Leave your ego at the door.

##Attitude
Leave your ego at the door. Rope is not a competition, enjoy others work without feeling treathened.

Create a character for yourself. Play with sexual identity and orientation. Be aware
of spatial relations and constellations. Carefully choose your distance and level of interaction.

## Determination
Be sharp. Clear actions and reactions. Avoid small talk.
Openly communicate attraction and rejection. Engage eye
contact before body contact.

## Resonance
Listen. Slow down. Silence. Always have an ear for the
music and all other sounds. Never be the one person here
that speaks the loudest.

Devotion
Be ready to play with power. Rule or surrender. Take control.
Give up control. Practice patience. Be gentle and kind.
Humour
Be ready to switch roles. Challenge your ideas of reality.
Deconstruct. Let go. Smile.

Grace
will happen automatically if you keep all this in mind.
Participation is at your own risk and responsabiiity. We reserve the right to
exciude anyone fiom the event at any time.
