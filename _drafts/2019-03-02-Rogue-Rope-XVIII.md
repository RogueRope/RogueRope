## Fun Fact!
------------------------------------------------------------
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%92ostre): Why do only English speakers celebrate “Easter”? Most other peoples of the world call the holiday observed by Christians this Sunday by some variant of the word “Pascha.”

The former pagans in England called April, “Ēosturmōnaþ” — Old English for the “Month of Ēostre.” The Christian holiday was called after a goddess of theirs named Ēostre, in whose honor feasts were celebrated in that month.

Ēostre is variously depicted by scholars as a fertility goddess and a goddess of dawn and light. The dawn connection could explain a linguistic link between Ēostre and the word “east.”
