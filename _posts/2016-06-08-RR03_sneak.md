Ready for another session? Same place but on the **25th of June**.  
Feel free to [register your place for RR#03](http://goo.gl/forms/Wb4w2Agv0hrBp0zt2) before the event is made public.

I've updated the formula a bit, and we will start with an absolute beginners workshop at 19.00. The attic opens for everyone, around 21.00.

The content will be really basic:

- Safety instructions
- Single/double column tie
- Basic handling of rope and flow
- Rope to body and body to body interaction

I'm sorry but this workshop is only available for **couples**, in the most loose definition of the word. Thing is... you need someone to tie.

Switching is **fine**.

More info and details will follow.
