Happy new year, my dear scoundrels!

I'm sure we've all put "do more rope" on the list for 2019. Alas, this month we're processing our hangovers, but from Feb we're back! 

Some mark your calendar with a big fat red cross on the second of February.
Then, click 'I'm going' on the event on Fetlife. 
And send in the form.
All new years resolutions should be this easy and fun. See you in Ghent. 

More space to fly 
The nest of the Ledebirds has gotten bigger. We now have 3 points to suspend from. It's cozy and warm even during harsh winters. 

However room is limited and more and more people are interested. So sign up today.

First come, first served.


Eat More Soup!
Not unlike Jesus, I just need a few ingredients to feed the masses. I'll throw vegetables and herbs in a pot to keep you going for the duration of the night. 

I'll probably bake some goods as well. We'll see how that goes. 
 


Codeless dress code
In the spirit of it being a night out rather than a lab session, we've updated the dresscode to "make an effort".

So come on birdies, show us your feathers.

Some dudes might think this only applies to the dudettes, but they would be sadly mistaken.
