# All good things must come to an end...

## Quick summary for the peeps that didn't make it:

* We had 30 guests.
* Financially, we managed to break-even.
* The food was delicious (BBQ / Pasta/  Indian food truck)
* There was an indoor and an outdoor play area.
* And -oh my God- there was some serious play going on.
* We had several interesting workshops. 
* We had a performance night with 3 world class shows.
* Weather was good, only one storm.
* The feedback received  was unanimously positive.

## My personal observations.
People connected well, of course humans tend to gravitate to their cliques but there was plenty interaction between the different groups.
 
The volunteering went good in the sense that things got done, but we should provide a better system to distribute the workload between everyone.
 
It was a lot of work and learning for me, but I've seen plenty of happy faces which kept me going. I'm totally inspired for next time(2021?).
 
At one point a party tent provided by a visitor was killed by a storm. Ligatio set up a fundraiser and the visitors collected enough money to replace it. It was wonderful and very heart warming to see the community come together in such a way.

## Personal Thanks
It feels silly to start naming names, since so many of you contributed to co-creating this event...

A warm thanks to: 
* The people that helped getting stuff set up, the day before the event started.
* The people that managed the kitchen and those that helped prepare the food, fix the coffee in the morning, prepared breakfast and the snacks, and those that helped cleaning after people were done.
* The people that made a basic truss construction into something cozy that invited people to use it for play, many decorated their tents, and made the environment into something special and unique.
* The people that gave me valuable feedback on how things could be improved, and the people that took the initiative to improve it.
* The people that gave workshops and performances, it's never easy to be in front of a group of people but you did it and informed and entertained us.
* The people that helped with the tear down and cleaning.
* All guests for sharing their smile and energy, so we could have this wonderful mix of people to enjoy. The voyeur in me is very happy...
* My sweet merel for supporting me throughout this project.

## What's next?

For starters, I need to relax for a bit, and am looking forward to sharing the after-movie with you, this is under construction and will be released soon(ish).

Then, the plan is to get back on the monthly Rogue Rope cycle. When and where? Your guess is as good as mine. We will see.

A camp like this year is still on for next year, but I need to rethink the concept a bit, based on the lessons I learned this year. Should it be bigger? Should we stay the same size? Do we still offer the full catering and how can we scale this up in a sustainable way? Will we still use the site we've used this year, or move on? 

I'm sure I'll get more clarity on these questions in the coming months, and if I decide something, I'll be sure to let you know.  I met a bunch of creative people to help me with this, and if I could channel this energy to set up a new event I'm sure it will be even more awesome than this year.

If you have any comments, feel free to contact me trough FL or some other medium.

Big Hugs, 

Hans F.
