# Hasta La Vista, 2020!

Dear Comrades,

I hope this bulletin finds you well. It has been 161 day since the last update from Rogue Rope HQ. We have been enduring the lock-down. Morale is down, but we keep fighting for the cause.

At least the French still know how to throw a party, let us commemorate their efforts, and raise our glasses to our fallen and incarcerated co-conspirators.

When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty.

However, in the current day culture of fear, illicit operations are a challenge. Unfortunately I have some furniture and don’t live in a squat, so they will find me. Fines are 750€ for visitors and 4.000€ for organizers.

Risk reward ratio is not so good here. :-)

In these times a stunt like our legendary yoga-camp won't fly. Remember the 50 person cuddle-bubble? The Rogue Rope legal team has searched high and low, but -this time- has found no loopholes to exploit.

Adding to this, the live-and-let-live mindset is gone, and people seem to be very happy to report each other. Which makes me a bit sad, nobody likes a tattletale.

## Anyway, my lovely perverts, I digress. Let's get to the meat of the message.

Rogue Rope Strategic Coordination in cooperation with the Rogue Rope Foresight and Forecast Department has after long deliberation decided on the following multi-phase plan:

### Phase 0: keep our head down, lest it’ll be chopped off.
* Stay inside, keep informed, do not switch off you TV.
* Take note of names and actions by policy makers, remember these for the next time you vote.
* Remind yourself: big-data is watching you.
* [Go back to bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WTBkj8gFfI), and be a good loyal citizen/worker/consumer.

### Phase 1: Find the perfect time to strike.
* We’re monitoring the evolution of the different virus strains. Spoiler alert: it ain’t looking good.
* We are meticulously processing all government rules and regulations.
* Our special ops and logistics are looking for spots to create unique experiences.
* We will be luring in the shadows, out of sight but not out of mind.

### Phase 2: the reboot
* If Phase 1 completes, we’ll have some perspective on what’s possible at what time.
* From the first time something -anything- is possible and legal, or the risk/reward balance flips, we’ll be back.
* There’s still the attic, so expect in this phase a back-to-basics Rogue Rope Session.

### Phase 3: Release the Kraken!
* Rogue Rope Camp is not forgotten.
* Plenty of ideas are fermenting in the dusty basement of RRHQ.
* The search for the ultimate location continues.
* Our intial assessment is this will not be before September, so if anyone has ideas for a location that would allow an in-door version. Hit us up.
* If you have any crazy ideas, let us know. Up for anything.
