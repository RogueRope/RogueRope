Not much to blog, this year. Well , not really , a lot to say, but to busy to type it out in this blog thing. Life's **not** online anyway. 

We had 4 great sessions, and eager for more to come.

So enjoy the artwork I ripped from Kitan Club magazine to make my flyers. Disclaimer: copyright stipulations made these beautiful pieces public domain.
