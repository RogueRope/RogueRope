So if you got one, see you Saturday.

**Time:** 21st of May, Starts at 20.00h

**Be there:** A lot of people have signed up already, even more than anticipated. So please let me know if you can't make it. Use [REDACTED] or [REDACTED], to make sure people on the waiting list have a chance to come.

**One General Rule:** Be excellent to each other.
Try to be the best guest possible to the other attendees of the session. From this mantra you can deduct all other non-existing rules. Like, not touching people or their stuff without permission and respecting others' boundaries.
If you need an elaborate rule set to follow these basic commands, you might not be the person to attend this party.

*Do try to excel in openness, friendliness, generosity and empathy.*

**Payment/admission:** [Pay what you want](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want)
I don't feel the need set one price for everyone to pay, so I'm leaving this up to you. Organizing this event takes some time (planning, administration, lots of cleanup before and after) and some money (snacks, heating, drinks).
In return the event generates value: emotions, joy and hopefully some happiness.
When you leave, evaluate how much value you've gotten from this night and try to convert that into an amount you feel comfortable paying. You can pay in cash, Bitcoin or use the Bancontact app. 

**Dresscode:** Feel free to wear whatever. Comfortable is fine, sexy if you feel like it. Feel free to use our dressing room to change clothes.

**What to bring:** Snacks and drinks will be provided, so no worries. Just bring ropes, your inspiration and creativity.

**Parking:** you should be able to find a spot nearby, if there are no spaces left you can surely park at the end of the street near the water. You might be tempted to park at the big parking lot next to the house, don't, my neighbor lives there and needs the space.

**Limits:** feel free to do stuff as long as you're qualified to do it safely, with enthusiastic consent from all participants. Candles are OK but fire play in a dry attic seems risky. There are rubber mats to keep the carpet clean when using candle wax, use them if necessary. Feel free to ask me questions if you have them. 

**Last but not least:** the setup is experimental, it's not a typical rope jam, it's not strictly defined as a party. Come over with an open mind and heart and the realization that the event can only be so great as you make it. I'm just as curious and anxious as you are.
