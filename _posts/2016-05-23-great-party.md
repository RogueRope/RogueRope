We were happy to welcome 17 people. We've missed some old friends *(sorry you couldn't make it)* and made some new ones (**yeey!**).

The vibe was good, a calm atmosphere, but filled with energy. I'd like to thank all visitors for their presence and participation.

Things we've learned:

 * People seem to prefer the healthy snacks over the sugar ones... 
 * ... but sugary cola over coke zero.
 * Donation averages to 10â‚¬, so this will be the *suggested* donation from now on?
 * Visitors tend to show up fashionably late around 20.30 - 21.00.
 * The count of 17 visitors is a bit of a soft limit. It's very intimate but that makes it extra fun. 
 * Some music worked better than other, more ideas for stuff to put in the new play list.
 
## So what's next?
Will give you an update very soon.
