## Nicolette - No Government
No government is a way of life
No government means to trust your friends
I know who I am and you know who you are

If everybody knew what they wanted
There'd be nothing, nothing left
People would do what they wanted
And there'd be no government.

## The "we are our own people" edition.

Theme was based on yet another fall of the Belgian gouvernement.

Some Updates: 

* New space to fly 
* Like the birds we migrates slightly south. Ledeberg bitches! 
* The nest was made before last edition, but is already being upgraded to version 2.0.
* It really ties the room together.  

Bascially the same but Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, or something like that.


## Soup!
Nobody told us but we listened anyway.
Winter = soup.
So your favorite bondage chef will throw vegetables and herbs in a pot to make a concoction that does not only feeds your body but also soothes your mind.
The pot was not empty last time, so come all, and come hungry. 


## Codeless dress code
First and foremost, let me state: naked is still fine.

Previously the dress code was "from naked to ski outfit", now the dress code is "make an effort".
In the spirit of it being a night out rather than a lab session.
So come on birdies, show us your feathers. Btw naked is still fine.

Some dudes might think this only applies to the dudettes, but they would be sadly mistaken.

So what does "make an effort" mean?

I really have no idea, I cannot capture this in a list of materials like some other event. I leave it up to you to help shape this concept, and to come and show us (spoiler: cargo pants are disqualified).

_Btw did I mention naked is still fine?_
