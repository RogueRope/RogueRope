We've found a new home for 'the cold season'.



## What's the plan?

Chill but warm, bohemian atmosphere, with some eclectic heady music. Some drinks to stay cool, some healthy snacks but of course a lot of lovely sugary sinful ones.

The event revolves around rope but encourages combinations with other kinds of play, feel free to give this your own creative interpretation.

The usual concept is well developed and will be followed, but if you have any ideas to try, let us know. We're open for any experiments. After all, we provide the infrastructure but the ceremony is created by the guests.

Rules will stay the same, be nice, get permission for play and photos, be a fun person to hang out with. If this is hard for you to do without an elaborate set of rules, please do not attend.

Don't worry if you're not so experienced, bring ropes and a partner and enjoy yourself. There's no minimum level to partake and rope is a lot of fun even without the fancy I-learned-it-from-a-japanese-master patterns. Rope is not a competition.

Rope is about having fun, not about looking cool.

Safety is important though. We are concerned about animal rights, and this includes bunnies. If you want to try some new stuff in a friendly and safe environment and need a spotter, let me know, I'm always willing to help and there are plenty of knowledgeable people around.

Dresscode: Naked is fine, ski outfit as well.

Cost is also still the same: 10 euro per person. I return we'll provide drinks, snacks, and a cool play space. Should the price impose a barrier for your attendance, contact me in private and we'll see what we can do.
