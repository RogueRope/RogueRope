## So, what about this virus thing eh?
Bet you didn't see that one coming. Never I could've imagined the word 'lock-down' as so un-sexy. So my little rope-lovin' munchkins, your favorite rope event was planning a continuation of our lovely jams. But then someone in Wuhan thought: "this bat tastes a little under cooked" and "how bad could it really be?"

So now *everything* is on hold. No fun! However, I wouldn't be myself if I didn't go ROGUE. Hah! While everybody and their mother is canceling, we are announcing, because that's just how we keep on truckin'.

We all need something to look forward to. And here I am, rising to the occasion. Your -one and only- savior, reaching out to the scared masses hiding behind their big piles of hoarded toilet paper. When spirits are low, and desperation is lurking around the corner, I'm here to brighten your mood, and broaden your perspective. 

### Sounds good dude, but what's the plan? 
Well, my dear padawan, we're going camping! In a (smallish) field, with a muthafuck'n tent! There will be a forest and water nearby witch we can use. Also there will be a big room with suspension points for *ahem* activities. Think of the possibilities!

Also you will be provided with food and drinks, so all you need to bring is your rope, camping gear and your teddy bear.
Pure festival or summer camp nostalgia here. But with warm showers, and relatively decent food. As you know we're more about the fun rather than profit, so we're hoping to fit in everyone's budget. 

Since all of my minions passed from Covid-19, and all my Oompa Loompa's managed to escape. I need you to help out a bit, a great way to truly become part of the experience. Also I'm hoping for some peer rope knowledge exchange. Maybe people can give small workshops, or bring gifts like massages to brighten each others days. 
As usual with Rogue Rope, most rules will go out of the windows, just be nice. Clothes will be optional as well.

### What if we're still in lock-down? 
Why so negative? Anyway. No worries, as usual, zero fucks will be given, and solutions provided! I'll put you in official service to Rogue Rope Inc. and will write each and everyone of you a note saying we need your services for the greater good of mankind, signed by yours truly. Ha! Show that to the Corona-Gestapo and the Covid-Stasi!

Upon arrival we'll use a thermometer to verify your health. No, you perv, we're not sticking it in there, it will be contact-less, trying to keep contamination *down* here. 

### Too good to be true, you say? 
Not at all! The lock-down is getting to him, you say? Not at all! Well, maybe. I'm just as sane as I was yesterday! Sort off... I'm the rock on which churches are built. The spinning cog in societies machine, the rock that resists the ocean. No virus shall harm me, call me the Belgian Bolsonaro, I'll lick the shopping cart to prove it to you. Totally not delusional! At all!

Alrighty then, sign me up!
Hold your horses, buckaroo! Let's do this the right way, this mail is to gauge interest and make you wet from anticipation. Also to pick a perfect weekend to do this. So move your pointy click finger to the button below and smash it. Answer 3 basic questions and wait for further updates.
