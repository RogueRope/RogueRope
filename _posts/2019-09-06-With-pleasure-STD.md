It's been a while, no worries, we're still alive. After the [bondage picnic](https://fetlife.com/users/1481316/pictures/83352492), destiny has us taking stuff even more public. This time we even have consent of the proprietors of the space we're taking, hmm, we must be getting old.

People have heard me say, "_Let's call it art, you can get away with much more if you call it art._", ironically, and to my surprise, this strategy is working out.

## What's all this about?

From [the website](https://www.vooruit.be/en/agenda/themas/38/With_Pleasure/) :

> _"[De Vooruit](https://www.vooruit.be/nl/home/) is giving guest curator [Eva Neklyaeva](https://www.vooruit.be/en/overig/Eva%20Neklyaeva) free rein. Sheâ€™ll be inviting everybody to come and explore the complexity of contemporary sexual expression together, at the intersection of performance and visual art, feminist porn, sex-related podcasts, BDSM, the latest sex tech, role play and sex-positive education. To imagine a world where consensual sexual pleasure is a human right._"

## Ok, so what does this mean for me?

We've been invited, together with the [House of Lupin](https://houseoflupin.be/) , and by extension you kinky lot, to set up camp here. This will take place on 12 - 13 - 14 December. Things are still developing but the plan is loosely as follows:
* On Thursday and Friday there will be an open space to have fun with ropes, and we'll provide some newbie friendly workshops.
* We end with a Rope Lounge on Saturday the 14th of December from 20.00 until late at night, where we'll try to recreate the good vibes of the RR Sessions by explicitly inviting our communities to come and hang out.

A definitive timetable is under construction , as well as the rest of the things you can explore when visiting the festival where the lounge will be part off. Tickets will be democratically priced available at the door.

This is the dance studio that will be provided to us.
Don't worry, cool lights and suspension points will be provided.

## Next steps:
* Mark your calendar.
* Wait for the next mail where all *definitive* info will be provided. If you haven't yet, click on the 'receive updates'-link.
* Check the [site of the festival](https://www.vooruit.be/nl/agenda/themas/38/With_Pleasure/) , not much info yet, but that will change in the coming weeks.
* Stay Kinky. :-)
