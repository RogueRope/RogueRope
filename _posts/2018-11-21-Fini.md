Leonor Fini (1907–1996) was an Argentinian surrealist painter, designer, illustrator, and author, known for her depictions of powerful women. 

> Her visual interpretation of sexual violence, first given rein in her Juliette illustrations, was continued in the images commissioned by Le Circle du Livre Précieux for a de luxe edition of Histoire d’O, which had been published in 1954 under the pseudonym Pauline Réage.
