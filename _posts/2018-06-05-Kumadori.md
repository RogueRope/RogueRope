This year I got inspired by Kabuki. 

Kumadori (隈取) is stage makeup worn by kabuki actors, particularly when performing in the bold and bombastic aragoto style. Kumadori makeup generally consists of brightly colored stripes or patterns over a white foundation, the colors and patterns symbolizing aspects of the actor's character. 

[Hasegawa Konobu](https://ukiyo-e.org/search/?q=Hasegawa%20Konobu) made these works :
