## You are awesome!

## Some observations.
Personally, I had much more mental bandwidth to enjoy myself compared to last year. The whole ‘delegate-all-the-things’ worked out great.

We had the **food** team taking care of lovely dishes to keep us energized, our **early birds** provided us coffee and other essentials when needed most. Our cozy world was built by the **infra-volunteers**. **Team content** did a great job of facilitating connections between people and organizing an exchange of ideas and creativity.

Also, my deepest appreciation for the **cleaning crew** that had awesome volunteers going above and beyond, so glad the place was kept so nicely until the end.

All these teams needed **volunteers**, and there was no shortage of helping hands when needed. The exodus was wet but also went more smoothly than expected. My buddy was pleased with the way we returned the tents.

If I were to name people, this mail would get very long and I’m afraid to forget somebody, but special thanks to **all the people that went above and beyond** in their contribution to his event.

I'm very grateful to deepen the connections I had with people last year and to make new ones with the people that joined us for the first time. It takes trust to set up a circus like this.

An event like ours is not only running catering and light. It is not a speaker stack, food stands and people watching a stage.

**The *audience* is the show.** So I want to express much love for the spankers and spankees, riggers and models, teachers and students, lovers and fighters, the mud people and the hammock hangers.

You lot are **the stars** of the show, and **dammit**, this was a **nice performance!**

One exception who I will name tough: my sweet **merel**, thank you for your continued support throughout this whole process.

All the love,

Hans F.
