**The good news:** we've found a spot. **The bad news:** not much room for new participants.

## The very short details
* **When:** 19/08/2021 14.00 -> 22/08/2021 16.00
* **Where:** East of Ghent, West of Antwerp
* **Cost:** 100€
* **Tickets:** Can be bought with voucher.

The amount of participants is limited, this is because of site limitations and Covid guidelines. The assumption is that demand will be much bigger than the supply.

## There are 2 ways to handle this:

* **The Tomorrowland way:** open ticket sales at a certain time and hope for the best. Tickets sales will essentially become **a lottery**.
* **The meritocratic way:** people who’ve **participated** before and made a positive contribution will have the opportunity to buy a pre-sale-ticket first.

After the closed pre-sale we'll have a free-for-all presale. To be part of this pre-sale, [join the mailing list](https://roguerope.be/pages/newsletter.html). If you participate in this pre-sale, you might be able to get a ticket. If you don't manage to secure your ticket, you'll be added to the waiting list. So maybe a spot will open for you at a later time.

If the covid rules allow us, we _might_ give you an option to buy a day ticket, this means you can come over on friday or saturday but not spend the night with us.

## Timeline: 
* First pre-sale : April 1 - 13:37
* Close of first pre-sale: April 30 midnight.
* Sending vouchers to the mailinglist for the free-for-all presale: First of May
* Start of free-for-all presale: Sunday May 9 @ 13.00

Next year, the plan is to double the available capacity, so more new people will have a chance to sign up.
