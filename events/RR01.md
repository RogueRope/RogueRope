# Rogue Rope Session 01

### “ A new rope event comes to town.”

**Announcement:** [Fetlife event](https://fetlife.com/events/370195)

**Date & Time:**	Friday, August 28, 2015 · 8:30 AM – 2:00 AM  

**Location:**	The Attic, Ghent, Belgium   @ map

**Cost:** 	€5

**Dress code:**	Clothes or nude.

**Description:**

This is an rope meeting in our attic. Several suspension points available. The main focus is active participation, open to all people regardless of skill set, level or style.

If you haven't done much bondage yet, that's fine. As long as you bring some rope and are ready, willing and able to play.

The main focus is rope, however if you want to combine your hemp or cotton with toys that spank, burn, spark or vibrate, that's fine too.

The goal is to create a space for free expression and experimentation, with respect for all participants and as few rules as possible.

**To register:**

Places are limited, hit the "I'm going" button here, but also make sure to use the sign up form. First come, first served. Top/bottom/switch couples that sign up are pretty much accepted by default. Solo tops and bottoms need to be a bit more patient, since this is an event with a focus on active participation, we need a balanced group.
