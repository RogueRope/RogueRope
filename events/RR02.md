Following the huge success from last year we are proud to present the next installment of the rope meeting in our attic.

If you haven't done much bondage yet, that's fine. As long as you bring some rope and are ready, willing and able to play.The main focus is active participation, open to all people regardless of skill set, level or style.

The main focus is rope, however if you want to combine your jute, hemp or cotton with toys that spank, burn, spark or vibrate, that's fine too.

The goal is to create a space for free expression and experimentation, with respect for all participants and as few rules as possible. We aim for a cozy vibe and have several suspension points available.

PS.
the address will be provided on the acceptance of your registration.
